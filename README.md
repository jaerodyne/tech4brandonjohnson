## What Is This?
Visit [https://tech4brandonjohnson.com](https://tech4brandonjohnson.com) to sign the pledge in support of Brandon Johnson, future Chicago Mayor.

## Why should I care?
Our leaders have failed us. Despite performative efforts, the staggering wealth of our nation still belongs to the rich, white, and male 1%. Meanwhile, the rest of us 99% continue to toil and serve capitalism to fight for our piece of the pie. ü•ß The Mayoral Race in the City of Chicago represents that great plight that we feel all around the world üåé and presents us with the unique opportunity to bring down a regime and a system that continues to marginalize, harm, and exploit whole identities, communities, and families that fall outside of the rich, white, male identity.

"The whole world is watching because if we can do this in Chicago, we can do it everywhere else." - Brandon Johnson on the importance of his Mayoral Candidacy as a born, bred, and active Chicagoan who is a former Chicago Public Schools educator, community organizer, and future public office collaborator.

The Chicago Mayoral Runoff Election is on April 4th, 2023. Let‚Äôs get to work.
