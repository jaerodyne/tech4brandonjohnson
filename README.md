# Bluise - A Nuxt.js & Netlify CMS boilerplate.

I wanted to explore Netlify CMS & Tailwind CSS, ended up creating this boilerplate.

So far we've got:

- Blog w/ posts, including pagination.
- Configurable manifest & global settings.
- CSS Markdown (Thanks to [https://github.com/iandinwoodie/github-markdown-tailwindcss/blob/master/markdown.css]).
- Dynamic pages.
- PWA ready.
- SEO ready for posts & pages.
- Signup form (using Netlify Forms).
- Tools (Commitlint, Husky).
- Typescript.

Few things I'd like to add in the future:

- Contact form under \_slug.
- Dynamic sections/widgets.
- Responsive CSS markdown.
- Tests
