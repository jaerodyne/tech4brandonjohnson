3. 📣 ChatGPT has spoken.
> ChatGPT: Brandon Johnson has developed a comprehensive gender equity and justice plan for Chicago to address discrimination and pay disparities faced by girls, women, and transgender and gender non-conforming persons in the city. Johnson aims to make Chicago a national model for gender equity and reproductive rights. His plan includes launching a citywide effort to end gender-based violence and sexual assault, advancing economic opportunities for women and girls, expanding health care access and protecting reproductive rights, and strengthening care infrastructure. Johnson also plans to create an Office of Gender Equity, establish a missing persons initiative, combat violence against trans women of color, and hold companies accountable for their workforce commitments. His plan addresses issues such as domestic violence, equal pay, women-owned businesses, mental health clinics, and paid parental leave.

🙋‍♀️ Now, here are the values and the issues I care about as a tech worker and general human being that are shared by Brandon Johnson as outlined by ChatGPT:

- Public Safety: Addressing gender-based violence, sexual assault, providing economic opportunities for women and girls

## Why I Believe In Change

🥧 Our leaders have failed us. Despite performative efforts, the staggering wealth of our nation still belongs to the rich, white, and male 1%. Meanwhile, the rest of us 99% continue to toil and serve capitalism to fight for our piece of the pie.

🥊 Brandon Johnson is a born, bred, and active Chicagoan who is a former Chicago Public Schools educator, community organizer, and future public office collaborator who runs in opposition to Paul Vallas, a far-right affiliated white supremacist who has eradicated public education in New Orleans, Philadelphia, and Bridgeport, Connecticut. Read more on Vallas's anti-union legacy [here](https://stopvallas.com/anti-union-privatization/).

🌎 The Mayoral Race in the City of Chicago represents that great plight that we feel all around the world and presents us with the unique opportunity to bring down an oppressive regime and its systems that continue to marginalize, harm, and exploit whole individual identities, communities, and families that fall outside of the narrow definition of what societal success looks like.

## TLDR; It takes all of us to enact change and progress as a society.

> *"The whole world is watching because if we can do this in Chicago, we can do it everywhere else."* - Brandon Johnson on the importance of his Mayoral Candidacy

This is a multi-generational, multi-racial movement that takes all of us to enact change. I hope that you will join us because we can't do it without you: it takes all kinds to progress the advancement of human rights. ✊
